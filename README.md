# git-pairing
A small repo to practice fixing merge conflicts on git.

## Use

* Use `git status` along the way to keep track of what's changing

1. Clone the repo
2. Checkout the `calculate-total` branch
3. Merge master into the branch `git merge master`
4. Solve the merge conflicts (practice with both the GUI and the classic approach [click the 3 dots, then click 'dismiss'])
5. Add & commit your work
